A Deep Learning Methodology for Detecting and Visualizing Continuous Gravitational Waves


Since the Gravitational Waves' initial direct detection, a veil of mystery from the Universe has been lifted, ushering a new era of intriguing physics, astronomy, and astrophysics research. Unfortu-nately, since then, not much progress has been reported, because so far all of the detected Gravi-tational Waves fell only into the Binary bursting wave type (B-GWs), which are created via spinning binary compact objects such as black holes. Nowadays, astronomy scientists seek to detect a new type of gravitational waves called: Continuous Gravitational Waves (C-GWs). Unlike the compli-cated burst nature of B-GWs, C-GWs have elegant and much simpler form, being able thus to provide higher quality of information for the Universe exploration. The direct detection of C-GWs can upgrade our Universe view, enabling scientists to study and analyze the structure and the existence of the most extreme stars and wonders of our Universe, which is impossible so far. Nevertheless, C-GWs are much weaker comparing to the B-GWs, which makes them much harder to detect. For this task, we propose a novel Deep-Learning-based methodology, being sensitive enough for detecting and visualizing C-GWs. This work can potentially help scientists to improve their detection sensitivity, leading to new Astrophysical discoveries, via the incorporation of Da-ta-Mining and Deep-Learning sciences.
